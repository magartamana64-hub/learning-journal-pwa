Flexbox helped align inputs and results neatly, keeping the layout responsive and clean. Media queries were tricky at first, especially maintaining layout consistency across different screen sizes."

The biggest challenge was ensuring the script executed after the DOM was ready, which I solved with DOMContentLoaded. Debugging with Chrome DevTools helped track variable values and find issues such as null references. Local Storage was used to persist my theme toggle across all pages."
