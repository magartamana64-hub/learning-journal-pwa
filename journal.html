            <h2>Weekly Learning Journal</h2>
            <p>Each week, I reflect on my learning progress, challenges, and new skills gained in Mobile Application
                Development.</p>


            <article class="journal-entry">
                <h3>Week 1: Frontend Fundamentals (Temperature Converter PWA)</h3>
                <p><strong>How did you approach mobile-first design?</strong><br>
                    I designed for mobile screens first with a simple layout and large buttons. Then I used media
                    queries to adjust for bigger screens.</p>

                <p><strong>What was the most useful HTML or CSS concept you applied?</strong><br>
                    Flexbox helped align inputs and results neatly, keeping the layout responsive and clean.</p>

                <p><strong>What part of HTML or CSS did you find most challenging?</strong><br>
                    Media queries were tricky at first, especially maintaining layout consistency across different
                    screen sizes.</p>

                <h3>Week 2 : Frontend Fundamentals</h3>
                <p><strong>How did you approach mobile-first design?</strong><br>
                    I started designing for small screens first, ensuring content and layout were simple and functional.
                    Then I used media queries to adjust for larger screens.</p>

                <p><strong>What was the most useful HTML or CSS concept you applied?</strong><br>
                    Flexbox was the most helpful tool for creating a clean and responsive navigation layout.</p>

                <p><strong>What part of HTML or CSS did you find most challenging?</strong><br>
                    I found media queries slightly tricky at first, especially balancing font sizes and spacing across
                    devices.</p>

                <h3>Week 3 : JAVASCRIPT & DOM MANIPULATION </h3>
                <p><strong>Which DOM selection methods did you use, and why did you choose them?</strong><br>
                    In this lab, I used several DOM selection functions, including getElementById, querySelector, and
                    querySelectorAll. I used getElementById since the unique elements, namely the navigation header and
                    the theme toggle button, required particular interaction. The ease of manipulating certain elements
                    of my interface made it easy to use querySelector to target specific elements by using the CSS-style
                    selectors. In the meantime, querySelectorAll() came in handy to extract several links in the
                    navigation and underline the current page. A combination of these approaches offered the
                    flexibility, ease, and accuracy when it comes to dynamically updating content and design on all the
                    pages of my Learning Journal website.</p>

                <p><strong>What was the most challenging part about linking JavaScript with your HTML?</strong><br>
                    The most difficult part of my JavaScript and HTML connection was getting my script to be loaded when
                    it was the right time. My code had not initially worked, as it was executed before all elements in
                    the HTML had loaded. My solution to this was the DOMContentLoaded event, which makes sure that
                    JavaScript does not run until the DOM is ready. The other difficulty was the functionality at a
                    multi-page level. As an illustration, my theme toggle had been functioning on one page, but it was
                    reinstated when I used other pages. To solve this, I employed Local storage to store the preference
                    of the theme that the user had. These problems helped me to understand how crucial the correct
                    timing and continuous data are in the process of JavaScript development.</p>

                <p><strong>How did you test and debug your JavaScript code?</strong><br>
                    Browser developer tools, in particular the Console of Google Chrome, proved to be quite helpful to
                    test and debug my JavaScript code. To track the values of variables, ensure that the right element
                    was selected, and ensure that event listeners were functioning, I relied on statements of
                    console.log statements. Whenever there were mistakes, i.e. a null reference, I realised that my
                    script was being executed prematurely or in search of elements that were not present. I had also
                    been updating pages and changing between them to ensure that Local Storage retained the right theme.
                    Regular testing helped me to understand how important real-time feedback, incremental debugging, and
                    the application of developer tools are to make sure that everything works in my Learning Journal
                    PWA.</p>
