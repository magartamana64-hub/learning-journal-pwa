            <h2>Weekly Learning Journal</h2>
            <p>Each week, I reflect on my learning progress, challenges, and new skills gained in Mobile Application
                Development.</p>

                <h3>Week 1: Frontend Fundamentals (Temperature Converter PWA)</h3>
                <p><strong>How did you approach mobile-first design?</strong><br>
                    I designed for mobile screens first with a simple layout and large buttons. Then I used media
                    queries to adjust for bigger screens.</p>

                <p><strong>What was the most useful HTML or CSS concept you applied?</strong><br>
                    Flexbox helped align inputs and results neatly, keeping the layout responsive and clean.</p>

                <p><strong>What part of HTML or CSS did you find most challenging?</strong><br>
                    Media queries were tricky at first, especially maintaining layout consistency across different
                    screen sizes.</p>

                <h3>Week 2 : Frontend Fundamentals</h3>
                <p><strong>How did you approach mobile-first design?</strong><br>
                    I started designing for small screens first, ensuring content and layout were simple and functional.
                    Then I used media queries to adjust for larger screens.</p>

                <p><strong>What was the most useful HTML or CSS concept you applied?</strong><br>
                    Flexbox was the most helpful tool for creating a clean and responsive navigation layout.</p>

                <p><strong>What part of HTML or CSS did you find most challenging?</strong><br>
                    I found media queries slightly tricky at first, especially balancing font sizes and spacing across
                    devices.</p>
